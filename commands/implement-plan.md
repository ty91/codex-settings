# Implement Plan

You are responsible for executing the approved plan in `PLAN.md`. Use phase checkboxes to drive progress.

## Context

- Plan file: `PLAN.md`

## Process

1. Read `PLAN.md` first.
2. Locate phase headers with checkboxes (`## - [ ] Phase N: ...`).
3. Find the first unchecked phase and work on it next.
4. Do not skip unchecked phases.
5. After completing a phase, mark its checkbox as checked (`- [x]`).
6. If `PLAN.md` is missing, inform the user and suggest running `/create-plan`.
7. If a phase requires manual verification, pause and ask for user confirmation before proceeding.
8. When no unchecked phases remain, report completion.
